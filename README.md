[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEic_p_X3IT3Y0_C5auTQUj6etelGuU5izRQdbiOrqOY8EjUYaTUx080Wh6XHeKC_UWePxbzVK-9nJiM99B4e5wwcXp4_BKuNNrNLDWWITcu3xVuo3wO37JFVyhwRIIt4RTmEukAfMyC7a9i8yYft_5BK2O-XqCEA3d59jvngRDMaUZpa_TEAkb4501e/w640-h360/Screenshot%20(503).png)](https://www.glitco.com/get-liv-pure)

On the official website of Liv Pure, it is stated that the supplement is created based on a new scientific study that discovered the root cause of weight gain in men and women. The study found a common factor in people who are overweight and compromised liver function. As you all might know, the main function of the liver is to cleanse all toxins and chemicals from your body. But the liver also has another function that many aren’t aware of. This is determining whether the food that you eat should be burned as energy or stored as body fat and this is why your liver is called the fat-burning furnace. When your liver is not functioning, it will lead to fat accumulation in your body instead of burning them for energy.

Now that we know the root cause of that is causing weight gain, the main task here is to improve your liver functioning. Liv Pure has two complexes of ingredients that work on purifying your liver and improving its functioning. The supplement provides you with the ingredients that remove any pollutants and toxins from the liver. Then the ingredients of the supplement work in synergy to optimize liver functioning and trigger fat burning in your body. When your liver starts to function properly, it will burn the food that you eat for energy and prevents fat accumulation. This leads to healthy weight loss.

He gave Liv Pure a try after his wife insisted. In the first few weeks, he didn’t see many changes in his body weight but after a month, he noticed that his belly was smaller than it was before. Then when he stepped onto the weighing scale, he noticed that in 30 days, he lost about 6.5 pounds. After that, it was only rapid weight loss for Kane. He lost all of the extra fat in his body including the stubborn belly fat that he always had trouble losing. Kane says that he is very thankful to Liv Pure for giving him a healthy and lean body that everyone compliments him these days.

Gabriella Miller, a 52-year-old working as a financial consultant in Los Angeles says that Liv Pure transformed her body in a way that she never imagined.

**Negative Reviews And Complaints By Liv Pure Users**

Joe Chen, a taxi driver in Texas says the Liv Pure that he bought from Amazon has done nothing for him.

But on the official website of Liv Pure, it is said that a bottle has 60 capsules. Chen also didn’t get a refund from the Amazon seller even though she returned the product.
